2048 Game Implementation in Python with Pygame

This project is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using Python and Pygame library. In this game, players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. 

Features:

- Classic 2048 Gameplay: Experience the original gameplay of the 2048 game.
- Pygame Graphics: Utilizes Pygame library for graphics and user interface.
- Save/Load Game State: Allows saving and loading of the game state to continue gameplay later.
- Undo Move: Provides an option to undo the last move.
- Dynamic Board Size: Supports dynamic resizing of the game board.
- Colorful Tiles: Tiles are rendered with different colors for better visual representation.

Files:

- 2048.py: Contains the main game logic and interaction with Pygame.
- constants.py: Defines colour constants used for rendering tiles.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

How to Play:

1. Installation:
   - Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Execution:
   - Run `2048.py` using Python to start the game.
   - Use arrow keys to move tiles: Up, Down, Left, Right.
   - Press 'R' to reset the game, 'S' to save, 'L' to load, and 'U' to undo.

3. Gameplay:
